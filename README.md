# plink-helper

So, I wrote this tiny script out of frustration when I was asked to configured some 60 odd servers from a restricted windows machines which only had putty allowed. so to automate running scripts / commands on all or many machines at one go I wrote this helper script for [plink.exe](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/plink.exe)
